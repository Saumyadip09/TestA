git status

Here we have (for example)
a file modified
a file deleted
a file in a sub directory modified.
a file in a sub directory deleted.

also had 
untracked files in current directory
untracked files in sub directory.

git add -A or git add --all
(Stage all of the changes in the entire
working tree inlcuding sub directory)
even in sub directory git add -A 
will stage even in one directory above.

git reset will revert it.

Now if we want only the directory to work than
git add -A mydir/



2. git add -u or git add --update
(modified and deleted files but not untracked files)-for the entire tree
git add -u my_dir/ 
will work only on the my_dir folder....

3. git add .  (. means the current directory)
it will be same as git add -A if we are in the top directory....
but in a sub directory the git add . will only work on the that directory (or it's subdirectory
but not the directories above it).
git add -A will do for all.


4. git add *(not recommended as * is a show command )
normal like ls *
(it will not list the hidden files or the deleted files) they are tracked by git

now git add * will not show the hidden files and also may not show all the deleted files
(It is possible that git add * may show some files which are deleted in the sub directories but not in the
current directory or the directory above).
