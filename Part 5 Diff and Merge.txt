Improve the visualization
We can use tools 
(diff-merge)
Using this tool the visualization is much better.

side by side comparison

instead of typing git diff
we are typing 
git difftool


Similarly instead of git merge
we can use git mergetool

A merge conflict comes when from master and from another feature branch we change the same file.
