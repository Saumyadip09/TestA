to switch between branches while doing some work in them..
or 
temporary saving of the files and go to other branches....

git statsh save "Worked on add function"

git diff
-no change
git status
-nothing to commit

If we see our file the changes are gone.

git stash list 
(list the changes)...

There are two ways to stash the changes back...

1.git stash apply stash(0)...get it from get stash list command....

**git checkout .. (this will reset to where we started)

2. git stash pop (This will take the top stash and will delete the stash as well).

git diff will show the changes...





4. git stash drop  stash@{0}
5. git stash clear (It will remove all the stash) - be very careful

6. Also stash can carry over from branch to branch
Say we made some changes to master branch and later we realize that we should have worked
on the feature branch.
git stash save ""
git status
git checkout branch
git stash pop
